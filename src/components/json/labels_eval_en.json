Depending on your selection (corporate website or a library website), different sectors to be evaluated are available to choose. The matching components appear automatically when you select the sectors to be evaluated. Mandatory components are selected by default, but you are free to choose which sectors or components you want to evaluate. You can revoke your selection at any time and select new sectors or components to your question catalog.",

By clicking on the plus sign next to \"Insert comment\", an input field will be displayed in which you can also enter notes for a specific criteria. For questions with info icons, click on it to get further information about the question.",
          "It must be pointed out that the problem classification (\"severity rating\") may not always be an easy task, in particular for people with little experience or background knowledge in UX. However, the purpose of this problem classification is not to provide an exact evaluation - it is about being able to set priorities for the elimination of the identified issues. It is not so important whether a problem has been classified as a \"moderate usability problem\" or a \"severe usability problem\". After all, every problem that a user experiences in handling a website lowers the quality standard of the corresponding web site and should be corrected. In order to obtain a more accurate error classification, it makes sense to run such evaluations with several reviewers. But individual users should also get a quick feeling which weak points are likely to cause major problems for the end user and which lacks are more cosmetic in nature. A detailed explanation of each problem classification can be displayed at any time in the survey. For this purpose, an info button is available which can be found in the upper right corner next to the problem ratings."

          "With regard to the users, a single serious error that prevents the users from achieving their goals, can be more problematic than a large number of smaller weaknesses that are more cosmetic in nature.
